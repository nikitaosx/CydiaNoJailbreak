# CydiaNoJailbreak
The database for the Cydia non-jailbreak package manager

Apps:
AltStore - A good marketplace for all devices since iOS 13. (till November 17, 2022)
CyDelete - Can uninstall the apps and Cydia. Comes with BackMyi (a quick uninstaller of all apps) and Reinstall (an app that quickly resets your iPhone). BackMyi and Reinstall don't support iOS 15 and later.
iOS 6 Theme - A theme that makes your iPhone look like iOS 6. Changes Cydia and YouTube's icons.
Real Cydia - This is the REAL Cydia. You can download Anemone (a theming engine) from it.
YouTube - Google's most famous video blogging service.

Compatibility problems:
AltStore: Doesn't work on iOS 7. On all pre-iOS 13 devices running at least iOS 8, the store itself works good, but most apps don't support it as good.
CyDelete: BackMyi and Reinstall don't work on iOS 15 and later.
iOS 6 Theme: No problems, compatible with all devices.
Real Cydia: Doesn't work as good since iOS 13. Anemone supports iOS 10 and later.
YouTube: Incompatible with iOS 6 Theme.
